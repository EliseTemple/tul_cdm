        <Page_Text>Lawrence N. Park  Professor of Law  DEDICATION  We, the Class of '67, gratefully dedicate this Yearbook to  Lawrence N. Park, Professor of Law. In so doing, we wish  to express our appreciation for his advice, guidance and sage  counsel to many classes through the years and, in particular,  to our class. From the beginning of our journey, in our  travels over the Alps and, finally, upon our arrival in Italy  (as Mr. Park would say), he has been with us.  In Property, Constitutional Law, and Land Transfer classes,  he not only imparted to us his understanding of theory but  shared his great knowledge of the day to day workings of  the law. Without forgetting the importance of professional  demeanor and the necessity of dedication to legal study, he  recognized that many serious tasks must be tempered by  humor.  We thank Professor Park again for helping to make our  years at Temple Law School enlightening and enjoyable, and  we leave with the hope that graduation will not mark the end  of our association with him. </Page_Text>

        <Page_Text>TEMPLE LAW QUARTERLY  t       ■«**/  The Temple Law Quarterly was established in 1927, and  has been published quarterly since that time by the student  body of the School of Law under faculty supervision. Student  editors are chosen on the basis of legal scholarship and past  contributions to the Law Quarterly. Election to the Board  of Editors is a high scholastic honor. Student writing for the  Law Quarterly is one of the best forms of legal education. It  requres resourcefulness, accuracy, and thoroughness in the  analysis of legal problems and authorities, in making critical  judgment with respect thereto, and in the synthesis of material for the purpose of cogent expression.
