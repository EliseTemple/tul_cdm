A portion of the Franklin H. Littell papers has been digitized to offer online access.

Franklin Littell (1917-2009), emeritus professor of religion at Temple University, led a distinguished career that spanned more than seventy years. He was a pacifist and activist, proponent of the Christian Laity and an advocate for new religious movements, an historian, political commentator and supporter of the State of Israel. He devoted ten years to work with the Protestant Churches and Laity in US occupied Germany and more than fifty years to the study and remembrance of the Holocaust and German Church Struggle. Though his activities and affiliations changed over time, he maintained strong beliefs in interfaith understanding and religious liberty his entire life.

Currently, manuscripts of most of Littell's "Speeches, lectures, and article manuscripts" dating from 1940 to 2002 are available digitally, though more will be added. Also available are correspondence and administrative records relating to his work with the National Council of Methodist Youth from 1934 to 1944.
