He devoted ten years to work with the Protestant Churches and Laity in US occupied Germany and more than fifty years to the study and remembrance of the Holocaust and German Church Struggle. Though his activities and affiliations changed over time, he maintained strong beliefs in interfaith understanding and religious liberty his entire life.</p>
